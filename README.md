# PF Final Project – 1st Semester

This is my final project for the **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** course, 1st semester.  
The project is mainly written in **C**, with a `.cpp` file used for some file-handling concepts. It is a **console-based application** demonstrating basic programming skills.

## 📌 Features
- Create and manage accounts
- Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds
- Check account balance
- View mini statements and transaction history
- Stores data in files for persistence (`.dat`, `.txt` and `.csv`)
- Console-based, beginner-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C** (core programming)
- **C++** (.cpp file for file handling)
- File operations for saving and loading data

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.  
3. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ project2.cpp -o project2.exe    # Windows
   g++ project2.cpp -o project2        # Linux/macOS
   
Run the program:
./project2.exe   # Windows (or .\project2.exe in PowerShell)
./project2       # Linux/macOS

The program will create files like accounts.dat and transactions.csv automatically when you run it.
